Hi, I am Sumit, a Software Engineer based in Seattle, Washington.

I'm interested in a wide variety of topics, both software engineering related (distributed systems, Kubernetes, LLMs, developer tools, etc.) and not (biking, cooking, history, politics).

This blog is a random assortment of things I find interesting. I'll post here whenever I come across something I find useful. This is written for an audience of one (me) so I can easily find this again when I need it!
